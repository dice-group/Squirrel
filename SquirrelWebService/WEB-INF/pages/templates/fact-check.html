              <p>This PG is composed of 3 parts which will be meshed together depending on the composition of the PG.</p>
    
              <ol>
                <li>
                  First, the PG will implement a crawler. 
                  In particular, focused crawlers are of 
                  central importance to gather domain-specific 
                  information from the Web to feed domain-specific 
                  applications including domain-specific search 
                  engines, digital assistant and education platforms. 
                  With the emergence of the Semantic Web as a 
                  supplementary layer of the Web comes the need 
                  to develop hybrid focused crawlers, which can 
                  gather domain-specific information from both 
                  the Document Web and the Web of Data as well 
                  as synchronize this information so as to return 
                  concise high-recall &nbsp;domain-specific corpora. 
                  In this task, the PG will devise algorithm for the 
                  classification of website, the classification of 
                  triples and the integration of text and Semantics. 
                  The crawler will be scalable and run efficiently 
                  in parallel. The data gathered will be cleaned 
                  and formatted so as to render further processing 
                  easier. The storage of provenance information is 
                  regarded as a must so as to be able to backtrack 
                  and update the corpus. See further

                <li>
                  The next phase is focused on Link Discovery. 
                  Link Discovery is one of the pillars of the Semantic Web. 
                  The core idea is to connect distributed knowledge graphs so as 
                  to create a Web of Knowledge that can be used to address complex 
                  information needs. In this PG, iterative approaches to data 
                  integration and link discovery are to be developed. 
                  These approaches must scale to the billions of entities 
                  described on the Web of Data. An important requirement for 
                  this task comes from the semantics of the links, 
                  which can be used to validate, invalidate and propagate linking results. 
                  Distributed algorithms will hence need to be developed to achieve 
                  the goal of continuously updating the links across knowledge bases. 
                  The core of the work will be carried out by extending the currently 
                  fastest link discovery framework available, LIMES 
                  (<a href="http://limes.sf.net">http://limes.sf.net</a>).<br><br>        
                </li>
          
                <li>
                  Third, the goal of a fact checking algorithm is to validate or invalidate 
                  statements by finding confirming sources for it on the Web. 
                  Typical fact checking algorithms take statements such as 
                  "Jamaica Inn was directed by Alfred Hitchcock" as input. 
                  They return a value between -1 (definitely false) and &nbsp;1 
                  (definitely true) by gathering information from the Web of Documents. 
                  In this PG, we will go beyond the state of the art and rely both on the 
                  Document Web and the Linked Data Web to gather evidence (including their provenance) 
                  for facts being true or false. 
                  The evidence will be combined using scalable machine learning algorithms 
                  to provide the user with time-efficient fact checking possibilities. 
                  We will focus on providing a justification for the results returned by 
                  our approach and develop interfaces (REST, natural-language, etc.) to the core algorithm.

                The required skills include good knowledge of the Java programming 
                language and the willingness to delve into exciting research. 
                The development will be carried out using Git in a Scrum-like setting. 
                The developers of LIMES will support the team and provide them with &nbsp;the 
                opportunity to impact the whole of the Semantic Web community. 
                Furthermore, we will offer a strong supervision based on the development 
                work already invested into the DeFacto framework 
                (<a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/DeFacto">http://aksw.org/Projects/DeFacto</a>).<br>
