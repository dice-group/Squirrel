/**
 * <p>
 * This class tests the following situation. Three different threads are running
 * in parallel sharing the same {@link IpAddressBasedQueue} instance. The first
 * thread adds URIs to the queue until the second thread has finished its work.
 * Every added URI has the same type and one of two IPs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The second thread takes a single chunk, thus, blocks one of the two IPs and
 * sets this IP in the third thread. After that the second thread sleeps for a
 * long time. At the end of this sleeping period, it informs the other two
 * threads about its termination, marks the ip as accessible and terminates.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The third thread requests new chunks from the queue (with a lower frequency
 * than the first thread is adding them) and checks whether it gets chunks
 * containing the IP blocked by the third thread. After the second thread has
 * finished, this thread makes sure that it gets at least one time URIs of the
 * IP that has been blocked by the second thread.
